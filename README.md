# Idevtier's OS
This project was created for fast and smooth setting up of Debian based linux for my terminal workflow

## Components
- tmux
- neovim
- fish
- fonts (Iosevka SS04 with Nerd Fonts)
- qutebrowser
- development deps (pyenv, nvm, rustup)

## How it works?
At first script clones my dots to `.config` directory. Then installs all needed [deps](##Deps)
